# Database Conversion Web Application - Project Plan

## Overview
Building a full-stack web application for converting between SQL (MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB), and JSON formats. The app features a modern SaaS UI with secure, session-based operations and no persistent storage.

---

## Phase 1: Core UI Layout and Navigation ✅
**Goal**: Establish the main application structure with tabs, forms, and layout components.

- [x] Create main page layout with header, navigation tabs, and content area
- [x] Implement tab system for switching between conversion types (SQL→NoSQL, NoSQL→SQL, JSON→SQL, JSON→NoSQL)
- [x] Design and build SQL connection form (host, port, username, password, database)
- [x] Design and build MongoDB connection form (connection string, database, collection)
- [x] Create JSON file upload component with drag-and-drop support
- [x] Add conversion type selector with clear visual indicators

---

## Phase 2: Preview System and State Management ✅
**Goal**: Implement data preview functionality and comprehensive state management.

- [x] Create state management for all connection forms and file uploads
- [x] Build preview pane component to display sample data (limit 10-20 items)
- [x] Implement table selection dropdown for SQL connections
- [x] Implement collection selection dropdown for MongoDB connections
- [x] Add validation for all input fields with user-friendly error messages
- [x] Create loading states and skeleton loaders for async operations
- [x] Build result display component for conversion output

---

## Phase 3: Backend Integration and Conversion Logic ✅
**Goal**: Implement server-side conversion logic and database connections.

- [x] Install required packages (pymongo for MongoDB, mysql-connector-python for MySQL)
- [x] Create backend endpoints for SQL connection and table listing
- [x] Create backend endpoints for MongoDB connection and collection listing
- [x] Implement SQL→NoSQL conversion logic (table rows to MongoDB documents)
- [x] Implement NoSQL→SQL conversion logic (MongoDB docs to SQL schema + inserts)
- [x] Implement JSON→SQL conversion (infer schema, generate CREATE and INSERT statements)
- [x] Implement JSON→NoSQL conversion (parse JSON, prepare for MongoDB insert)
- [x] Add preview endpoints to fetch sample data from databases
- [x] Create downloadable output generation (JSON files, SQL scripts)
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling with secure logging

## Phase 4: Testing, Polish, and Security
**Goal**: Test all conversion flows, add polish, and ensure security best practices.

- [ ] Test all four conversion types end-to-end with real data
- [ ] Add success animations and toast notifications
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Cmd+K for command palette if applicable)
- [ ] Add help tooltips and documentation for each conversion type
- [ ] Security audit: ensure no credentials logged, sanitize all inputs
- [ ] Add rate limiting and input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Responsive design testing (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Performance optimization for large dataset previews

---

## Phase 5: Advanced Features and UX Enhancements
**Goal**: Add sophisticated features that make the app production-ready.

- [ ] Implement schema customization options before conversion
- [ ] Add batch conversion support (multiple tables/collections)
- [ ] Create conversion history viewer (session-based, non-persistent)
- [ ] Add export options (CSV, JSON, SQL script formats)
- [ ] Implement dark mode toggle
- [ ] Add data type mapping configuration (SQL types ↔ MongoDB types)
- [ ] Create conversion templates for common use cases
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running conversions

---

## Phase 6: Documentation and Final Testing
**Goal**: Complete documentation and ensure app is user-ready.

- [ ] Create in-app user guide with examples
- [ ] Add sample data generators for testing
- [ ] Write comprehensive error messages for all failure scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing with large datasets (1000+ records)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Create README with setup instructions
- [ ] Add disclaimer about complex schemas requiring manual review
- [ ] Final security review and penetration testing

---

## Notes
- **Security First**: No persistent storage, all operations session-based
- **Preview Limits**: Cap at 20 items to maintain performance
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly messages, no technical jargon
- **Modern UI**: Linear/Stripe/Notion-inspired design with Indigo primary color
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
